The output is a list of topics, each represented as a list of\nterms (weights are not shown).\n\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization is applied with two different objective\nfunctions: the Frobenius norm, and the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence.\nThe latter is equivalent to Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing.\n\nThe default parameters (n_samples / n_features / n_components) should make\nthe example runnable in a couple of tens of seconds. You can try to\nincrease the dimensions of the problem, but be aware that the time\ncomplexity is polynomial in NMF. In LDA, the time complexity is\nproportional to (n_samples * iterations).\n"
